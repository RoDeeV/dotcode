# dotcode
A new programming language developed by the dot.team.


We see that many languages already released have syntax that are far from English, so we decided to create a programming language that takes this into mind. The syntax matches of what would be a version of English, but missing a couple of words. This program was created using a mixture of Google's Blockly and pure JavaScript 

# Example Script
```

when executed
  createVariable(baz)whichWillBeSetTo("foo bar") 
  log("foo bar")
end, exit number is set to 0
```
