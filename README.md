# dotcode
A new programming language developed by the dot.team.


We see that many languages already released have syntax that are far from English, so we decided to create a programming language that takes this into mind. The syntax matches of what would be a version of English, but missing a couple of words. This program was created using Batch and Bash (which means this is avaliable on Windows and Linux)

# Example Script
```

when executed
  createVariable(baz)whichIsSetTo("foo bar") 
  logInOutput(baz)
end, exit number set to 0
```
